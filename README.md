# Sign-Language-Translation
small project, will be updated regularly

should work as a camera too ;)
will be updated when I have the time.

# This project was inspired by tutorials and open-source repositories on sign language recognition.
I studied multiple sources, then adapted and incorporated them into my code.
- Made using OpenCV, Sci-kit, Python
- Inspiration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJCSjXepaAM
- One repository I really recommend: (https://github.com/laplaces42/sign-language-interpreter)
- I will add features to this.
